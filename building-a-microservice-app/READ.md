# Building a Microservice App

Building a cloud native app using a Microservice based architecture enables monolith applications to get split so that teams can independently develop the microservices so that they are scalable and can be deployed to production separately.

In a microservice architecture the frontend and backend separated.  The frontend application controls all of its own UI-level logic, while the business logic is accomplished through API calls to the relevant microservice. 

## Frontend Design

While many architects don't normally cover the frontend applications as part of the microservice architecture, in this example we will spend some time quickly discussing some of the options.  In the traditional frontend and backend design, the Mobile App or Website directly accesses the backend service, the backend microservices call each other, and then return the final result to the frontend client. For clients (especially mobile), too many HTTP requests are expensive.

Therefore, in order to minimize the number of requests, the frontend generally tends to obtain associated data through a single API. It means that sometimes the backend will do some UI-related logic processing to meet the needs of the client.

Using the BFF approach, each client will have a BFF service. With BFF, there are fewer mutual calls between microservices. This is because some UI logic is processed at the BFF level.

In addition, using the BFFâ€™s approach the frontend (Mobile, Web) no longer directly accesses the backend microservices, but rather accesses it through the BFF layer. 

## API

In this context, the BFF acts as a middle-tier providing access between the frontend and backend. 

API ...

For example, lets consider a commom microservice, called "account". Many applications need an "account" microservice.

There are a couple ways to design the api to work with the microservice. 

Here are a cAPI Gateway does not distinguish between client types:
1. Single API for all clients
   ```
   /api/accounts
   ```

1. Separate APIs for each client and then processes them separately to return the resources required by different clients.
   ```
   /services/mobile/api/accounts
   /services/web/api/accounts.
   ```

1. Multiple API Gateways provide separate APIs for each client
BFF is actually considered like this implementation mode of API Gateway.

## REST API 

REST can be accessed through the following way:

Request:

```

GET http://127.0.0.1/api/accounts
```

Response:
```
[
  {
    "id": 88,
    "name": "Mena Meseha",
    "photo": "http://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/photo.jpg"
  },
  ...
]
```
