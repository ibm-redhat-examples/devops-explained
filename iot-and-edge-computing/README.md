# IoT and Edge Computing

Historically, IoT embedded devices generate large amounts of data  this waste is partly due to a dogmatic default to the device-edge-cloud model. 

This approach involves the network of IoT devices sending large sums of data to a local edge computer. The edge then either processes that data to push to a cloud repository or pushes the data first for the cloud to process.
