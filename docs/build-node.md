IBM has a set of web app patterns that can be used to produce apps that serve web content such as HTML, JavaScript, and stylesheets to the web server.

For this tutorial we will be using the [React web app starter kit](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/dashboard).

Each starter kit is generated with configurations to connect to added services , files for deploying to Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes or a DevOps Pipeline, and files for using app metrics for monitoring and distributed tracing. They're also generated to reflect the architecture pattern you chose. This starter kit falls under the Web App architecture pattern shown above. To learn more about the Web App architecture pattern, visit the IBM Cloud Garage Method Architecture Center at ibm.biz/WebAppPattern.   

starter kit provides rich framework to build user interfaces. The source files are in src/client/app, and are compiled with WebPack and served in the public directory.

A starter kit sets up your application, so you can get started creating a Cloud Native application quickly. Each starter kit is generated with configurations to connect to added services , files for deploying to Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes or a DevOps Pipeline, and files for using app metrics for monitoring and distributed tracing.

The role of the Express.js React Web App within the Web App architecture pattern is to provide dynamic content, which corresponds to the "application server" element (labeled 5) in the architecture pattern. This starter kit includes the following frameworks: 1) Express.js: The most popular web framework for Node.js applications 2) React: A JavaScript library for creating User Interfaces 3) App Metrics: The Node Application Metrics package for monitoring and distributed trace.
