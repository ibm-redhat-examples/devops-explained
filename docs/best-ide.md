# Choosing the Best IDE

As an Cloud DevOps Architect, I often am called upon to assist teams with defining tooling standards for projects. 

While most developers often will use their preferred IDE no matter the "offical standard", defining a standard does serve several purpose. Defining IDE standards for the team helps when you need to define an integrated set of tools for building, testing and deploying applications. Also from a supportability standpoint its easier to debug issues if your developer, tester and integrator have similar tooling. 

Deciding which IDE will best suit your project often depends on
- the nature of the projects under development, 
- your role in the organization, 
- the process used by the development team, and the
- the teams skills as programmers. 

Finally, selecting the best IDE is also often language dependent, such that Java Developer may prefer one IDE while a NodeJS developer may choose another. For this blog we will focus on three different developent languages: Java, NodeJS and Python.

# Java
Given the number of years Java has been used, there is a large variety of IDEs that you could use. So will focus on the IDEs that I have had to use personally and share links to where other others have evaluated Java IDEs. 

From my experience, choosing the right IDE is essential for the Java Developer and often comes down to type of project, plugins available and the developers famililarty with the IDE.  

For example in the case of server-side development, I have had the opportunty to use the following IDEs IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and BlueJ. For this roundup, I did fresh installations of IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2018.3, Eclipse IDE 2018â€‘09 for Java EE Developers, and BlueJ IDE 9 on a Mac. My comparisons include setup, ease of use, integration with key tools, like Docker, git and other development tools. 

My preference was
  1. Eclipse
  2. BlueJ
  3. IntelliJ

Eclipse is often listed as one of the big three of Java IDEs that is available in both desktop and cloud editions. Both Eclipse editions come with a large variety of plugins available from the "Eclipse Marketplace". I like eclipse because it support a large number of programming languages via plugins. C, C++, Clojure, Groovy, Haskell, JavaScript, Julia, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Rust, and Scala. In addition it as a large number plugins supporting automated testing, build and deploy to several of the popular Cloud environments and flaunts powerful tools for charting, modeling, reporting, and testing.

BlueJ is an integrated development environment that can use used for small-scale Java projects. Its mainly designed for educational ouroises but is still widely preferred by some Java veterans.

IntelliJ IDEA comes in 2 different editions, an Apache 2 Licensed community edition, and a proprietary commercial edition and is also one of the big three of Java IDEs. It's a powerful IDE that boasts cross-language refactoring and data flow analysis features.

Other features offered by IntelliJ IDEA that eases the life of a Java developer are chain completion, language injection, smart completion, and static member completion.
